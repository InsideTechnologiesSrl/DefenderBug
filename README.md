# Defender ASR Bug

On January 13th, Windows Security and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint customers may have experienced a series of false positive detections for the Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rule "Block Win32 API calls from Office macro" after updating to security intelligence build 1.381.2140.0. These detections resulted in the deletion of certain Windows shortcut (.lnk) files that matched the incorrect detection pattern. 

There’s no way to restore the icon but there’s a way to rebuild the most common to Start Menu with this script.

I will keep updated the script every day.
